# Running Notes
- to compile the lexer and parser run the script run.sh it will generate the .c and compiler.exe files
- to pass the text file to the .exe file run **_compiler.exe < input.txt_**
- print statements is outputed in the console after running the .exe file for debugging
- if an error occurred it will print syntax error and exit the file

# Compiler notes 
- we are trying to mock the c++ compiler
- in **if statements** it must include semicolon at the end of it if there is no **else statement**
- break and continue can be only used inside loop statements (for, while, switch, do-while)
- block structures are implemented 
- functions are implemented void function doesn't have a return and returned type functions must have a return
- inline and block comments are implemented 
- block comments cannot include * in it
